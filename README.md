# Credit Risk Classification

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to develop and assess a machine learning model that predicts the creditworthiness of potential borrowers using a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending company. By analyzing loan risk, the model aims to support the company's decision-making process by identifying borrowers with high and low credit risks.

## Results

- **Balanced Accuracy Score**: 95.20%
  - This score combines sensitivity (recall or true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate), indicating that the model achieves a balanced prediction accuracy of 95.2%.
  
- **Precision Score**: 92%
  - This score shows that 92% of positive predictions (high-risk loans) were correctly identified by the model.
  
- **Recall Score**: 95%
  - This score indicates that the model correctly identifies 95% of true positive values out of all positive predictions, showing its effectiveness in detecting high-risk loans.

## Summary

The logistic regression model performed well, with a high accuracy rate (95.20%) and strong precision and recall scores. Based on these results, I recommend using this model for predicting borrower creditworthiness. Its accuracy and reliability make it a valuable tool for informing lending decisions, helping to minimize default risk and maintain sufficient capital flow for profitability. 

Incorporating this model could enhance the company's ability to manage risk while potentially increasing loan approval rates for low-risk borrowers.
